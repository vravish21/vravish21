👋 Hi there, I'm Varshni Ravishankar!

Currently wrapping up my Master of Science in Business Analytics at the W. P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University, I'm diving deep into the fascinating world of data analytics, machine learning, and how these technologies can transform business processes. With a solid foundation in computer science from Anna University and hands-on experience as an Assistant System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, I've honed my skills in enhancing operational efficiencies, data accuracy, and software feature improvements, boasting a commendable 95% defect resolution rate.

🔍 My professional journey has allowed me to develop and execute comprehensive project plans, streamline analytics processes, and ensure data integrity across various platforms. I'm particularly passionate about leveraging NLP and machine learning to automate and improve decision-making processes, as evidenced by my work in the Capstone Project with HCLAppScan and other impactful projects at ASU.

🛠 Skills-wise, I'm well-versed in Python, SQL, NLP, sentiment analysis, and a suite of data analysis tools like Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, and more. My toolbox also includes advanced Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and various programming languages and technologies pivotal in today's data-driven landscape.

💡 I love exploring new ways to apply text analytics and machine learning to solve real-world problems, such as enhancing supermarket operations or predicting house prices with high accuracy. My project experiences range from developing advanced analytical visualizations to employing sophisticated machine learning models for strategic decision-making.
